## Problem Statement:
Existing Indian stock research tools struggle to connect data
with the complex factors affecting investments, hindering
informed decision-making.

Solution:
This project simplifies financial research . Our approach
involves building a conversational AI agent that you can ask
questions to, much like you would to a person and it will respond
based on real-time information. The AI goes beyond basic data
retrieval. It analyzes various factors influencing stock prices -
company financials, sector trends, market sentiment, candle history,
and even news analysis. This empowers users to understand the
"why" behind the insights, fostering trust and informed decisionmaking. The idea is to equip our agent with in-house tools for all
types of analysis, from real-time data to mathematical analysis. The
AI will have the autonomy to select and utilize these tools as often as
necessary to ensure the best insights in the form of conversation but
powered with the sources and interactive graphics.
